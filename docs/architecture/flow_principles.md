# Role flow diagrams (RLS-aligned)

ASCII flows for **super_admin**, **institution_admin**, **teacher**, and **student**, grounded in the current Supabase migration chain (`20260209*`, `20260321*`, `20260323*`, `20260325*` announcements, `20260326*` attendance / topic gates / game versions, `20260328*` cloud assets + storage RLS, `20260329*` course versions + `course_deliveries`). Policy names refer to Postgres RLS; behavior not listed here is default-deny for `authenticated` unless a policy applies. Diagrams assume the **full** migration chain has been applied (see migration table at the end).

**See also:** [15_platform_roles_schema_map.md](../domain/15_platform_roles_schema_map.md) (tables, helpers, domain trees).

## Student

**Who:** Active `institution_memberships` in institution A; optional rows in `classroom_members` for specific classrooms.

**Important scope split (Variant A)**

- **`courses` SELECT:** for `profiles.role = student`, only courses that pass `student_can_access_course(id)` (published + `course_deliveries` with `published_at` and `active`/`scheduled` in an assigned classroom). Teachers and institution admins still use the broader published-in-tenant branch of `courses_published_read`.
- **Topics / lessons SELECT:** only if the course passes `student_can_access_course` / the lesson `student_can_access_lesson` (Variant A policies: `topics_select_member` / `lessons_select_member`).
- **Classrooms SELECT:** only **assigned** (or you appear as member/co-teacher) — `classrooms_scoped_read`, **not** all classrooms in the school.

## Shared: `game_runs` modes (Phase C)

Applies across roles; **student visibility** of runs uses `gr_member_read` / `gs_member_read` / `gsp_member_read` as above.

```
game_runs
├── mode = 'solo'
│     ├── started_by = the student
│     ├── classroom_id = NULL
│     ├── invite_code = NULL
│     └── 1 game_session → 1 game_session_participant (the student)
│
├── mode = 'versus'
│     ├── started_by = challenger student
│     ├── classroom_id = NULL

      ├── classroom_id = the classroom (FK)
      ├── invite_code = NULL (notify via app)
      └── 1 game_session → N game_session_participants
            Teacher analytics via gsp_teacher_read / institution admin read policies

Status: lobby → active → completed | cancelled
```

## Shared: tasks → groups → submissions → notes (Phase D)

```
tasks (classroom_id, teacher_id, status, due_at, …)
│
├── task_groups (name, note_id → notes)
│   ├── task_group_members (user_id)
│   └── task_submissions (submitted_by, status, feedback, reviewed_by)
│
notes
├── personal — owner_user_id; scope = personal
└── collaborative — task_group_id; scope = collaborative; group members co-edit (RLS + Realtime in app)
```

Task status flow (audit trigger on tasks):  
`draft → published → not_started → in_progress → submitted → reviewed` (or `overdue`; `returned` for revision cycle) → `audit.log_task_state_change` → `audit.events`.

---

## Shared: chat, notifications, rewards (Phases E–G)

```
Chat (20260329)
  conversations → optional conversation_contexts (classroom / course_delivery / task / game_session)
  conversation_members → messages
  Helpers: app.user_in_active_conversation, app.caller_eligible_for_conversation_context
  RLS: participant read/send + contextual eligibility; institution_admin / super_admin paths; safeguarding matrix in docs/domain/11_chat.md mostly app-layer

Notifications (20260329000024–030)
  notification_events + notification_deliveries — fan-out via create_notification_event_with_deliveries; user read/update own deliveries; institution_admin read monitor
  notification_preferences — scoped base + overrides; user manages own

Rewards
  point_ledger — append-only; teacher/institution_admin manage per policies; student read own + class leaderboard scope
  classroom_reward_settings — teacher primary/co_teacher manage; student read assigned classrooms
```

## Shared: game versions & published pointer (20260326)

```
game_versions
  Teacher — draft-only INSERT/UPDATE on own games; SELECT own rows
  Institution admin — SELECT all versions in tenant
  Member — SELECT status = published + institution membership
  Anyone with run access — SELECT version attached to a game_run you can see (game_versions_select_run_access)

games
  games_select_authenticated_published — requires current_published_version_id → published game_versions row
  (replaces “any published game row” with versioned publish; see also games_schema_flex migration)
```

## Shared: cloud assets & storage (20260328)

```
cloud_folders, cloud_files, cloud_file_links, cloud_file_shares (public + RLS)
  super_admin / institution_admin → FOR ALL
  SELECT scope — user_can_select_cloud_folder / user_can_select_cloud_file / link helpers
  INSERT — owner_user_id = auth.uid() + member_institution_ids()
  UPDATE/DELETE — user_can_manage_* (primary teacher / co_teacher / manager paths in functions)

storage.objects (cloud bucket)
  storage_cloud_objects_rls — path + institution checks; aligns with DB file rows where applicable
```

## Product notes (not enforced by all RLS)

1. **Course catalog for students:** RLS aligns catalog with delivery — students only **see** courses linked to their classrooms (`courses_published_read` student branch). “My courses” in the app should match the same source (`course_deliveries` + `classroom_members`; `classroom_course_links` is legacy/backfill).
2. **Self-enroll:** Disabled for students (`ce_student_insert` / `ce_student_delete` removed in Phase A migration chain). Partial-class cohorts need another mechanism (extra class/group or reintroducing enrollments).
3. **Unpublish / draft courses:** Topic/lesson access for students follows `student_can_access_course` / `student_can_access_lesson` (Variant A). Decide product rules when `courses.is_published = false` but a classroom link still exists, or when the link is unpublished — policies may need tightening beyond current migrations.
4. **Telemetry:** No DB triggers on SELECT; `learning_events` rows require **client inserts**.

# Institution admin onboarding (DB / migrations)

Flow derived from `supabase/migrations/` — mainly `20260321000002_institution_admin_*` (`create_institution_with_initial_admin`, `invite_institution_admin_membership`, `activate_institution_invite`, alias `activate_institution_admin_invite`).

**Who can invite admins:** only **`super_admin`** (not a tenant `institution_admin`). **Email delivery and GoTrue user creation** are application responsibilities.

**No email-token table for admins:** `institution_invites` is constrained to **teacher / student** only (`institution_invites_role_chk`). Institution admins are always onboarded with a **known `user_id`** + `profiles` row, then optional GoTrue invite + `activate_institution_invite`.

## SQL mapping

| Step                            | Role in migrations                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorize admin                 | `invite_institution_member` / `create_institution_invite_by_email` require `app.is_institution_admin(p_institution_id)` or `app.is_super_admin()` |
| Invited membership (user known) | `invite_institution_member` → `institution_memberships` with `status = invited`                                                                   |
| Active membership               | `activate_institution_invite(institution_id)` → `active` + `user_institutions` insert on conflict                                                 |
| Email-first pending row         | `create_institution_invite_by_email` → `institution_invites` + returned token                                                                     |
| Redeem                          | `redeem_institution_invite(token)` validates email, expiry, acceptance; then membership + `user_institutions`                                     |

## Classroom / course access

Institution membership alone does not assign **classroom** or **published course** access; that uses later migrations (e.g. `classroom_members`, `classroom_course_links`, `app.student_can_access_*`).
